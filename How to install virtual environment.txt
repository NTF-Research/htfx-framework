4. Install requirements.
Because the libraries can run significantly faster on CUDA, we will prioritize using CUDA whenever possible. 
However, in reality, many graphics cards are outdated and cannot run the latest versions of these libraries, 
which leads to errors. 
Therefore, we need to choose a library version that is compatible with the CUDA version currently installed. 
So, please determine your exact CUDA version and select the appropriate options below.
